## Names of departments that employ M and F
## Employee: find dno that are matched with all sex
## alpha = dno, sex
a = project (employee) (dno, sex)
## beta = sex
b = project (employee) (sex)
## second half of equation
e2 = project ( ((project (a) (dno)) product (b)) difference (a)) (dno)
## full equation
div = (project (a) (dno)) difference (e2)
## get the department names from that list
d1 = (div) join (department) (div.dno = department.dnumber)
display(project (d1) (dname))
